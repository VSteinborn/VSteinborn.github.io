# Responsible AI Presentation

I had the oppurtunity to give a talk about responsible AI at a meetup event in Tokyo.

The event was sponsered by Quollio Technologies and focused on the topic of data.

This talk was aimed at beginners to the field and outlined a case-study on the energy requirements of training large language models, in particular GPT-3.

You can find the slides for the talk on Github using the provided [link](https://github.com/VSteinborn/talks/blob/main/2025-09-30-RAImetrics/2025-09-30-RAImetrics.pdf).
